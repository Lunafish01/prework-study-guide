I'm excited to start my web dev journey and I wanted to create this Prework Study Guide to help showcase and benchmark my fundamental understanding of web development as I progress in this journey. I decided to build this Prework Study Guide application primarily for my own personal use to help me keep track of notes, important information and for overall studying purposes throughout my bootcamp course. The Prework Study Guide will help me keep track of notes and stay organized while I learn this new skill at breakneck speeds. So far I have learned the basic fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript.
